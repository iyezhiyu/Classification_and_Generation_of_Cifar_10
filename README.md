# Classification and Generation of Cifar-10
## Introduction
This project is to do classification and generation of Cifar-10 dataset using deep learning.
## Modules
* resnet_to_classify_cifar10.ipynb: implement a ResNet18 and train it for Cifar-10 classification
* encoder_classifier_for_cifar10.ipynb: implement and train a convolutional autoencoder to reconstruct Cifar-10, and use the encoder as feature extractor and train a classifier to do Cifar-10 classification
* dcgan_to_generate_cifar10.ipynb: implement and train a deep convolutional generative adversarial network for generating Cifar-10 images
